The project is a Java program to sum values of an array.

This project requires that you know how to use the for loop and the array. I recommend you go into 1 programming college class or learn the basics to understand the project.

If you need help, either message me at aahmed58@nyit.edu, or search a youtube video on how to do it. Please don't spam me. I will do my best to get back to your message as soon as I can.

I (Ameer) is the only one who maintains this project.
